Level : Medium

## Problem 

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;

"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;

"R": turn 90 degrees to the right.

The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

## Solution

- If you end up where you started, it is a circle. 
- If you end up in a different place with facing north (again), hence you are drifting away. 
- All other scenarios are going to be in a circle (or come back) in infinity no matter. You can think that the starting and the end point form a vector. Unless the end direction is north, concataned vectors will always end up on the starting point eventually (infinity).
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) 
    {
        vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0,1},{1,0},{0,-1},{-1,0}};
        int x =0;
        int y =0;
        int dir = 0; // 0:north(up), 1: right, 2: down, 3: left
        
        for(auto& e : instructions)
        {
            if(e == 'L')
            {
                dir = (dir+3)%4;
            }
            else if (e == 'R')
            {
                dir= (dir+1)%4;
            }
            else
            {
                x+= directions[dir][0];
                y+=directions[dir][1];
            }
        }
        return (x ==0 && y == 0) || (dir != 0);
    }
};
```
