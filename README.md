Initiation taken by Faraz Khan and coperated by Bhushan,Sanket,Suraj. Below are few words by Initiator :)

Hey guys, planning to prep algo and problem solving ?

Here is a plan I have:

let us block 1 hour of time a day where we all can connect over zoom, pick one problem from leet code or any other site, try to solve it on own machine in 45 mins and we keep 15 mins to discuss our solutions, this way we can learn and share like we do in college days.

The challenge is that the time slot would be blocked and we should strive to attend it.

I call it "7 days 7 solutions" .

let me know if you guyz on board?
